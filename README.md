- **Real-time Signal Detection** based on proximity to heart wall
- **Dynamic Color Mapping** - electrodes change color based on signal strength (Blue ‚Üí Red)
- **Professional Medical UI** with live electrode data and signal visualization
- **Interactive 3D Controls** for catheter navigation and positioning
- **Auto-Mapping Mode** for automated demonstration of mapping capabilities
- **Live Progress Tracking** showing mapping completion percentage

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **C# / WPF / .NET 8** - Modern Windows desktop development
- **Helix Toolkit** - High-performance 3D graphics rendering
- **MVVM Architecture** - Clean, maintainable code structure
- **Real-time Data Binding** - Live UI updates
- **3D Mathematical Models** - Accurate signal strength calculations

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8.0 SDK
- Visual Studio 2022 or later
- Windows 10/11

### Installation & Running

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cardiac-mapping-simulator.git
   cd cardiac-mapping-simulator
   ```

2. **Open in Visual Studio**
   - Open `GlobeSystemSimulator.sln`
   - Restore NuGet packages
   - Build the solution (Ctrl+Shift+B)

3. **Run the application**
   - Press F5 to start debugging
   - Or Ctrl+F5 to run without debugging

### Using the Simulator

1. **Manual Control**:
   - Use the X, Y, Z sliders to position the catheter
   - Observe real-time signal changes in electrode displays
   - Watch electrode colors change based on contact quality

2. **Auto-Mapping**:
   - Click "Start Auto-Mapping" for automated demonstration
   - The system will automatically navigate around the heart surface
   - Monitor mapping progress in real-time

3. **Signal Interpretation**:
   - **Red Electrodes**: Strong signal (close to heart surface)
   - **Blue Electrodes**: Weak signal (far from heart surface)
   - **Progress Bars**: Visual representation of signal strength
